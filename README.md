#Witkoppen is a simple Patient Register#

It is named after the clinic it was developed for. It was build back in 2007 over a weekend as a favour to people 
who had a pressing need for it.

*This software is not compliant in any way to any security constraints imposed by any authority. 
You now know this.*

Witkoppen is a native fat client implimented in Python using the wxPython GUI library with a Postgress backend.
It is unlikely that any new development will happen on it as I'll proapably impliment in something like Django 
or Bottle today.
